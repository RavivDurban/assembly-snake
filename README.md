5.2.2023

This is the very first version of the project - there will be more.
- In this version there is a white snake and an apple (just a red dot for now).
- The white snake can move based on the players input (wasd) and is not moving naturaly.
- When the snake collides with the appple it gets longer by 1 segment.
- All mechanics regarding the snake's death are not implemented yet.

Things I still need to do:
- Create a start screen.
- Make the snake progress on its own.
- Deal with the snakes death.
- Add a score counter.
- Make the snake green.
- Add sounds.
- Create a border for the game field.

This is the last cersion of the project.
Other than sounds and a score counter which were apparently very difficult to implement in assembly (and for that reason did not make it to this version of the game), I have implemented every feature that is listed on 5.2.2023.
I hope you like the game and enjoy it enough to quit the google version :)
