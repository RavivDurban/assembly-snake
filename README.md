This is the very first version of the project - there will be more.
In this version there is a white snake and an apple (just a red dot for now).
The white snake can move based on the players input (wasd) and is not moving naturaly.
When the snake collides with the appple it gets longer by 1 segment.
All mechanics regarding the snake's death are not implemented yet.
